<h2 align = "left">⭐ News </h2>

1. In order to be compatible with multiple versions of T-Watch, all examples include a `config.h` file. For the first use, you need to define the **T-Watch** model you use in the `config.h` file
2. In the `config.h` file, you can also see similar definitions, such as **LILYGO_WATCH_LVGL**, **LILYGO_WATCH_HAS_MOTOR**, this type of definition, it will be responsible for opening the defined module function, all definitions Will be available here [View](./docs/defined_en.md)
3. Most of the examples are only used as hardware function demonstrations. This library only completes some initialization work and some demonstrations. For more advanced gameplay, please see [TTGO.h](https://github.com/Xinyuan-LilyGO/TTGO_TWatch_Library/blob/master/src/TTGO.h), to understand how to initialize, after being familiar with it, you can completely leave this library for more advanced gameplay

<h2 align = "left">🚀 Characteristics</h2>

1. The library already contains all the hardware drivers for `T-Watch`
2. Using **TFT_eSPI** as the display driver, you can directly call **TFT_eSPI** through the construction object.
3. Using **lvgl v7.3.1** as the display graphics framework, the driver method has been implemented, you only need to call lvgl api according to your own needs.
4. For the use of lvgl please refer to **[lvgl docs](https://docs.lvgl.io/v7/en/html/)**


<h2 align = "left">🔷 Install</h2>

- Install the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software). Note: Later instructions may not work if you use Arduino via Flatpak.
- Download a zipfile from github using the "Download ZIP" button and install it using the IDE ("Sketch" -> "Include Library" -> "Add .ZIP Library...", OR:
- Clone this git repository into your sketchbook/libraries folder. For more info, see https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries


<h2 align = "left">🔷 Note</h2>

- If you don't have the `TTGO T-Watch` option in your board manager, please update the esp32 board as follows:
  - Using Arduino IDE Boards Manager (preferred)
    + [Instructions for Boards Manager](docs/arduino-ide/boards_manager.md)
  - Using Arduino IDE with the development repository
    + [Instructions for Windows](docs/arduino-ide/windows.md)
    + [Instructions for Mac](docs/arduino-ide/mac.md)
    + [Instructions for Debian/Ubuntu Linux](docs/arduino-ide/debian_ubuntu.md)
    + [Instructions for Fedora](docs/arduino-ide/fedora.md)
    + [Instructions for openSUSE](docs/arduino-ide/opensuse.md)

<h2 align = "left">🔶 How to find the sample program</h2>

* T-Watch
- In the Arduino board select `TTGO T-Watch`
- In the Arduino File -> Examples -> `TTGO_TWatch_Library`

* LilyPi
- In the Arduino board select `ESP32 Dev Module`
- In the Arduino File -> Examples -> `TTGO_TWatch_Library`

 <h2 align = "left">🔶 Precautions</h2>

- T-Watch-2019 : Since Twatch uses a special IO as the SD interface, please remove the SD card when downloading the program.
- LilyPi       : Since Twatch uses a special IO as the SD interface, please remove the SD card when downloading the program.
